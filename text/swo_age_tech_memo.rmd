# INTRODUCTION

Under the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (NPFMC) Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Eastern Bering Sea, Aleutian Islands, and Gulf of Alaska, Tier 1, 2, and 3 stocks use statistical catch-at-age assessment models to estimate population and management quantities [@NPFMC2020bsai; @NPFMC2020goa].
While these models can vary in their specific implementation across stocks (i.e., due to differences in parameterization, error structures, or data availability), a critical and ubiquitous data component of this structure of assessment model is age and length composition data.
Age and length composition data are collected on both fishery-independent (e.g., bottom trawl or longline surveys) and fishery-dependent platforms, providing critical data to assessments in order to track population changes over time.
The Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) operates fishery-independent bottom trawl surveys [@Stauffer2004], spanning most of the continental shelf in Alaskan waters south of the Bering Strait, including the eastern Bering Sea (EBS), the Aleutian Islands (AI), and the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) that provide age and length composition data to 26 stocks (or stock complexes) assessed with statistical catch-at-age models.

At the AFSC, age and length frequency sampling from the bottom trawl surveys is used in stock assessment models in a variety of ways to inform estimates of population abundance that are subsequently used to set management quantities.
The most common use of length frequency sampling is to derive estimates of the population abundance-at-length that are used in conjunction with an age-length key to estimate population estimates at age, which are then converted to age composition estimates and fit in the model [e.g., @Spencer2022; @Monnahan2021]. 
Length frequency samples are also used in many assessments in a conditional-age-at-length framework [@Rudd2021] that both fits the length composition and enables estimation of growth internally to the assessment [e.g., @Mcgilliard2017]. 
In some cases, where age data is not available, length frequency samples which have been expanded to population abundance-at-length estimates are used directly as composition data within the assessment [e.g., @Mcgilliard2019]. 
Finally, recent developments have included using length frequency samples in a model-based framework to estimate length and age composition estimates [@Thorson2019; @Ianelli2021; @Thompson2021].

Predominantly, the multinomial likelihood is used to fit age and length composition data at the AFSC [e.g., @Bryan2021], while recently the Dirichlet-Multinomial has also been explored [e.g., @Barbeaux2022].
A common requirement, regardless of the likelihood employed, is a pre-determination of the input sample size that is used to 'weight' the particular year's age or length composition data that subsequently influences the precision of the assessment models fit.
Over the years, a variety of approaches have been used at AFSC to set the input sample size in stock assessments.
These include selecting a constant value [e.g., @Hulson2022], relating the input sample size to the number of hauls from which age or length composition data was collected [e.g., @Spencer2022], relating the input sample size to the nominal sample size [e.g., @Hulson2021], or relating the input sample size to some combination of hauls and nominal sample size [e.g., @Williams2022].
Overall, there is no general or consensus method that is agreed upon at the AFSC to determine input sample size.

@Stewart2014 introduced a method in which bootstrap techniques were used to resample age and length composition data that provides an estimate of the input sample size that can be used within assessment models.
The primary advantage of this method is that it provides an objective framework from which estimates of input sample size are obtained that mimic the sampling design employed, either on a fishery-independent survey or on fishery-dependent platforms.
Here, we apply the methods of @Stewart2014 to obtain historical estimates of input sample size for age and length composition data obtained by the AFSC bottom trawl surveys in the EBS, AI, and GOA for all stocks assessed at AFSC with statistical catch-at-age assessment models.
The main objectives of this technical memorandum are to 1) document methods used by AFSC for expanding length and age collections to population abundance estimates (which are subsequently used as composition data in stock assessments), 2) present stock-specific results of historical input samples size from AFSC bottom trawl surveys for Tier $\geq$ 3 stocks, and 3) record methods for estimating input sample sizes of survey-based age and length compositions using a two-stage bootstrapping approach.

# MATERIALS AND METHODS

## Survey Data

Data collection for each AFSC groundfish survey is described in respective NOAA Technical Memorandum [EBS: @Lauth2019; AI: @vonSzalay2017; GOA: @vonSzalay2018].
Length frequency protocols and recent analysis of sex-specific length frequency data are further described in @Hulson2023a.
To facilitate age estimation, individual fish are processed at sea to record sex, length and weight and to remove sagittal otoliths that are returned the AFSC Age and Growth laboratory for age determination.
Survey age sampling protocols are specific by fish species and follow 1 of 2 paradigms: 1) a stratified collection that is distributed over both the spatial frame of the stratification scheme and the expected size range of a species; or 2) a small subsample (3-6 fish, depneding on species) collected randomly per trawl.
The protocol for some species has changed over the time series, which has followed a trend of transitioning from protocol 1) to protocol 2). 
Species within each survey that are assessed with statistical catch-at-age models were selected to be included in this analysis (Tier $\geq$ 3 stock assessments, Table \@ref(tab:species)). 
Data from AFSC bottom trawl surveys conducted in the EBS shelf (1982 to present), EBS slope (2002, 2004, 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2016), AI (1991 to present), and GOA (1990 to present) were used to estimate input sample size for each of these stock assessments in this study. 


## Expanding Length Frequency to Population Abundance-at-Length

Length frequency samples collected by the AFSC bottom trawl surveys are expanded by catch and stratum area to obtain estimates of population abundance-at-length [this approach is also detailed in @Hulson2023a, we include the description here as well in order to provide a source for both the length and age expansions for reference].
This is often referred to as the 'first stage expansion' and is a common method to obtain population estimates at length from area-swept survey data [e.g., @Ailloud2019, @Miller2006].
Population abundance-at-length are computed for three sex categories: males, females, and unsexed at the stratum level, which are then summed across stratum to obtain the population abundance-at-length for the management-scale region (i.e., EBS, AI, or GOA), these can also be summed to any sub-region level.

In the first step of this process we compute the overall population numbers in year-*y* within stratum-*st* ($\hat{N}_{st,y}$) with:

\begin{equation}
 \hat{N}_{st,y}=\overline{CPUE}_{st,y}\cdot A_{st}
  (\#eq:eqn1)
\end{equation}
where $A_{st}$ is the area of stratum-*st* (in km^2^), and $\overline{CPUE}_{st,y}$ is the average catch per unit effort of numbers captured across the hauls within a strata, given by:

\begin{equation}
 \overline{CPUE}_{st,y}
  =\frac{1}{H_{st,y}}\sum_{h=1}^{H_{st,y}}CPUE_{h,st,y}
  =\frac{1}{H_{st,y}}\sum_{h=1}^{H_{st,y}}\frac{n_{h,st,y}}{E_{h,st,y}}
  (\#eq:eqn2)
\end{equation}
where $H_{st,y}$ is the number of hauls, $CPUE_{h,st,y}$ is the catch per unit effort of numbers caught within a haul-*h*, $n_{h,st,y}$ is the catch (in numbers) in haul-*h*, and $E_{h,st,y}$ is the effort in haul-*h*, which is computed as the net width multiplied by the time on bottom, or, the area swept by the haul (in km^2^).
Next, the ratio of catch per unit effort among hauls ($\hat{p}_{CPUE,h,st,y}$) is computed by:

\begin{equation}
\hat{p}_{CPUE,h,st,y}=\frac{CPUE_{h,st,y}}{\sum_{h=1}^{H_{sy,y}}CPUE_{h,st,y}}
  (\#eq:eqn3)
\end{equation}
where $CPUE_{h,st,y}$ is the catch per unit effort of numbers caught within a haul-*h*.
We then compute the sex-specific ratio of the total number of lengths sampled within a haul by length ($\hat{p}_{sx,l,h,st,y}$) with:

\begin{equation}
 \hat{p}_{sx,l,h,st,y} =
  \begin{cases}
    (1) \frac{N_{sx,l,h,st,y}}{N_{h,st,y}}  \\
    (2) \frac{\sum_{h=1}^{H_{st,y}}[N_{sx,l,h,st,y}/N_{h,st,y}]}{\sum_{sx=1}^{3}\sum_{l=1}^{L}\sum_{h=1}^{H_{st,y}}[N_{sx,l,h,st,y}/N_{h,st,y}]}
  \end{cases}
  (\#eq:eqn4)
\end{equation}
where $N_{sx,l,h,st,y}$ is the length frequency sampled, in numbers, by sex-*sx* and length-*l*.
In some cases there are hauls that have catch for a species but did not collect length frequency data, in this case (2) is applied in order to account for the unknown length frequency in these hauls, otherwise, if length frequency samples are obtained case (1) is applied.
Finally, we estimate the sex-specific population abundance-at-length within strata-st with:

\begin{equation}
 \hat{N}_{sx,l,st,y}=\sum_{h=1}^{H_{st,y}}[\hat{N}_{st,y}\cdot\hat{p}_{CPUE,h,st,y}\cdot\hat{p}_{sx,l,h,st,y}]
  (\#eq:eqn5)
\end{equation}
and to obtain the sex-specific estimates of population abundance-at-length in a management area one would simply sum $\hat{N}_{sx,l,st,y}$ across strata.


## Expanding Specimen Collections to Population Abundance-at-Age

In the second stage expansion the sex-specific estimates of population abundance-at-length are used to estimate sex-specific population abundance-at-age.
The annual specimen data that is collected during the survey, which includes observations of age at length, are first populated into sex-specific numbers at age and length ($N_{sx,a,l,y}$).
Next, the sex-specific numbers at age and length are converted to sex-specific proportions of age at length with:

\begin{equation}
 \hat{p}_{sx,a,l,y}=\frac{N_{sx,a,l,y}}{\sum_{a=1}^{A}N_{sx,a,l,y}}
  (\#eq:eqn6)
\end{equation}
The proportions of age at length are then expanded to population abundance-at-age with:

\begin{equation}
 \hat{N}_{sx,a,y}=\sum_{l=1}^{L}\hat{p}_{sx,a,l,y}\cdot \hat{N}_{sx,l,y}
  (\#eq:eqn7)
\end{equation}
where $\hat{N}_{sx,l,y}$ is the population abundance-at-length from \@ref(eq:eqn5) summed across strata.
For specimen data with observations of sex (either female or male), the sex-specific specimen data is used, however, for specimen data without observations of sex the specimen data is pooled across all sexes and the unsexed population abundance-at-length is then applied to the pooled specimen data to estimate unsexed population abundance-at-age.

Two general categories of special cases for several stock assessments were also included in our analysis: 1) spatially-explicit assessments, and 2) assessments for species complexes. 
For the majority of stocks assessed at AFSC age population estimates are computed at the management area scale (e.g., the entire GOA, AI, or EBS), however, we note that there are two flatfish stock assessments that are spatially-explicit in the GOA [@Mcgilliard2017; @Bryan2021].
While in the preceding equations we do not include a subscript for sub-region, population abundance-at-age can be estimated by sub-region through summing the population abundance-at-length in equation \@ref(eq:eqn5) across strata within the sub-region and applying equations \@ref(eq:eqn6) and \@ref(eq:eqn7) to specimen data that is subsetted to the sub-region.
We have developed functions to estimate population abundance-at-age by sub-region, and by a combination of sub-regions within the GOA to allow for this flexibility in estimating population abundance-at-age.
There are a handful of assessments conducted at AFSC that evaluate stocks at a complex level, where several species are included together in an assessment.
There are two stock complexes at AFSC in which the species are combined and assessed within the same statistical catch-at-age model: blackspotted and rougheye rockfish in the GOA and AI [@Spencer2020b; @Sullivan2021].
Between the two management regions there are subtle differences in how the population abundance-at-age is estimated from the survey specimen data; we have developed functions that allow for these differences and estimate population abundance-at-age for these two stock complexes. 
In a similar case, while not assessed as a complex, over the historical bottom trawl sruvey in the GOA several species codes have been used for dusky rockfish. 
We have also developed a custom function that estimates population abundance-at-length and age for this case. 


## Bootstrap Framework for Estimating Age and Length Composition Input Sample Size

To estimate the historical input sample sizes for age and length compositions of stocks assessed at AFSC we developed a bootstrap framework based on the methodology outlined in @Stewart2014. 
The bootstrap framework is composed of a suite of nested resampling (with replacement) protocols.
Functions to run the sampling protocols were developed in a compartmentalized manner to provide for substantial flexibility in exploring desired resampling protocols. 
The order of operations (Figure \@ref(fig:length)) has the following schedule, with steps 1-3 being optional switches:

1.  Resample hauls from the set of hauls with associated catch per unit effort (in numbers)
2.  Within the resampled hauls from step 1, resample the observed length frequency data
3.  Within the resampled hauls from step 1, resample the observed specimen data
4.  From the resampled length frequency data in step 2, calculate sex-specific population abundance-at-length, using equations \@ref(eq:eqn1) - \@ref(eq:eqn5)
5.  From the resampled specimen data in step 3 and the sex-specific population abundance-at-length in step 4, calculate sex-specific population abundance-at-age, using equations \@ref(eq:eqn6) - \@ref(eq:eqn7)

The bootstrap framework then repeated steps 1-5 iteratively, providing iterated sex-specific population abundance-at-length and age that was then compared to the historical sex-specific population abundance-at-length and age as observed by the bottom trawl surveys.
We ran the bootstrap-simulation for 500 iterations, which was a level for which the variability in population abundance-at-length results had stabilized.
The bootstrap-simulation was developed in R [@Rcore] and is available via GitHub as an R package (<https://github.com/BenWilliams-NOAA/surveyISS> *still need to make this a package*).


## Computing Effective and Input Sample Size

Effective sample size (ESS), as introduced by @Mcallister1997, is a statistic that can evaluate the level of intra-haul correlation in composition samples that are collected on a survey (whether from age or length frequency collections).
It is also a statistic that can evaluate the amount of uncertainty in an estimated composition compared to an observed composition.
Effective sample size is given by:

\begin{equation}
 ESS=\frac{\sum_{c=1}^{C}E_c(1-E_c)}{\sum_{c=1}^{C}(E_c-O_c)^2}
 (\#eq:eqn8)
\end{equation}
where $E_c$ is the estimated proportion for category-*c* (which can be either age or length or any other arbitrary category across which proportions are computed) and $O_c$ is the observed proportion.
It can be interpreted by a higher ESS indicates less uncertainty in the composition estimates, while lower ESS indicates more uncertainty. 

In this bootstrap-simulation, we used effective sample size to calculate uncertainty in length compositions for each simulation replicate where the underlying age and length compositions derived from the historical bottom trawl surveys was treated as the observed proportions $O_c$ in equation \@ref(eq:eqn8).
For each iteration of the bootstrap we computed a sex-specific estimated proportion ($E_c$) that was then compared to the underlying historical sex-specific age and length composition (the effective sample size for the total age and length composition, as the sum of population abundance-at-age and length, was also computed).
Thus, for each iteration of the simulation, we computed an effective sample size that quantifies the amount of uncertainty that resulted from each iteration of sub-sampling sexed length frequency data.

Input sample size (ISS) is defined as a metric of uncertainty used in data-weighting procedures for stock assessment models.
An input sample size is usually assigned to annual length compositions in the model fitting process, but there are a variety of methods for calculation -- many of which are closely related to the information content of the data product in question.
To summarize uncertainty across bootstrap replicates of ESS, we calculated ISS as the harmonic mean of effective sample size across bootstrap iterations

\begin{equation}
 ISS=\frac{I}{\sum_{i=1}^{I}(ESS_i)^{-1}}
 (\#eq:eqn9)
\end{equation}
where $ISS$ is the input sample size, $ESS_i$ is the effective sample size for iteration-*i*, and *I* is the total number of iterations for which the bootstrap procedure is run.
The harmonic mean has been shown to reduce bias in recovering the true sample size in simulations for a multinomial distribution.
Due to this reduction in bias the harmonic mean has also been recommended to determine the 'input sample size' that is used in stock assessment models to fit compositional data [@Stewart2014].
Herein, when we use the term 'effective sample size or ESS' we are referring to the effective sample sizes that were computed for each iteration of the bootstrap-simulation from equation \@ref(eq:eqn8), when we use the term 'input sample size or ISS' we are referring to the harmonic mean of the iterated effective sample sizes from equation \@ref(eq:eqn9).


# RESULTS

Average age and length composition nominal sample sizes (rounded to the nearest 10s for age and 100s for length) for the bottom trawl surveys evaluated are shown in Tables \@ref(tab:ebs-nss) - \@ref(tab:goai-nss).
Across the surveys, average sex-specific length composition nominal sample size ranged from around 300 to upwards of 35,000 samples per year, where the total length composition nominal sample size (for all sexes combined) ranged from around 700 to upwards of 82,000 per year.
The most frequently sampled species for length frequency within in Eastern Bering Sea shelf survey were walleye pollock, yellowfin sole, northern rock sole, and arrowtooth flounder, and in the Eastern Bering Sea slope survey were arrowtooth flounder, kamchatka flounder, and Pacific ocean perch (Table \@ref(tab:ebs-nss)).
The most frequently sampled species for length frequency within the Aleutian Islands bottom trawl survey were Pacific ocean perch, walleye pollock, and arrowtooth flounder and in the Gulf of Alaska bottom trawl survey were arrowtooth flounder, walleye pollock, flathead flounder, and Pacific ocean perch (Table \@ref(tab:goai-nss)).
Across the surveys, average sex-specific age composition nominal sample sizes ranged from around 130 to nearly 850 per year, where the total age composition nominal sample size (for all sexes combined) ranged from nearly 300 to over 1,500 per year.
It was commonly the case that the most frequently sampled species in each survey for age composition were the most frequently sampled species for length composition.

The age and length ISS output of the surveyISS package is structured by year, species (using the AFSC survey species code), sex, and region (an example is shown in Table \@ref(tab:surveyISS-examp)).
Using walleye pollock total age composition ISS as an example, the surveyISS package produces ISS by year for each survey the stock is sampled from (\@ref(fig:wallpoll-iss)).
Using yellowfin sole age composition from the EBS shelf survey as an example, the surveyISS package also produces sex-specific ISS (\@ref(fig:yellsol-iss)).
For all species sampled in each survey, the range and median of total and sex-specific length composition ISS across survey years is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:length-iss), and age composition ISS is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:age-iss).
Sub-regional ISS for age and length composition can also be estimated within the GOA survey, and is shown in Figures \@ref(fig:sublength-iss) - \@ref(fig:sublength-iss).
These results show that the length composition ISS ranged from the hundreds to thousands, and were larger than the age composition ISS.
It also resulted that the sex-specific ISS for either length or age composition were smaller than the ISS for the total age composition.

Whether for age or length composition (including sex-specific composition data) the ISS was smaller than the nominal sample sizes (Figure \@ref(fig:iss-nss), shown for age composition) and there was a generally increasing trend between nominal sample size and input sample size.
Comparing the age composition ISS to the number of hauls from which age samples were obtained did not result in a strong relationship for the flatfish and gadids sampled in the AFSC surveys, but there was an increasing trend for the rockfish species (Figure \@ref(fig:iss-hls)).
There was also an increasing trend that resulted between age composition ISS per sampled haul and the number of samples per sampled haul for most of the species sampled, and was the most striking for the flatfish species (Figure \@ref(fig:iss-nss-hls)).
The ISS for age composition was 2.6 per sampled haul for flatfish, 1.7 per sampled haul for gadids, and 1.5 per sampled haul for rockfish sampled by the AFSC surveys.
This translated to 0.36 ISS per age sample for flatfish, 0.22 ISS per age sample for gadids, and 0.26 ISS per age sample for rockfish.
