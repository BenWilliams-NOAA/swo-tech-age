# ABSTRACT

At the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) a number of fish stocks are assessed using statistical catch-at-age (SCA) models.
SCA models integrate various sources of data to inform estimation of population dynamics and management quantities for fisheries that target these stocks.
Two important information sources are age and length composition data, from fishery-independent (survey) and fishery-dependent sources.
When used in SCA models, age and length composition data require determining *a priori* the 'input sample size' to weight their relative information content against other data sources fit within the assessment model.
We developed an R-package that uses bootstrap methods originally presented in @Stewart2014 to estimate input sample size for age and length composition data from bottom trawl surveys conducted by the AFSC in the eastern Bering Sea, Aleutian Islands, and Gulf of Alaska.
Here we present annual input sample size estimates for length and age compositions (including sex-specific and sex combined compositions, and sub-regional compositions within the Gulf of Alaska) collected during Alaska bottom trawl surveys.
These new input sample size estimates provide an objective method that follows the sampling design of the bottom trawl surveys for fishery stock assessments.
We recommend that these input sample size estimates become a standard bottom trawl survey data product that are updated annually and available to assessment authors for inclusion into AFSC fishery stock assessments.
Software provided can also be used on a less-frequent basis for research to explore the consequences of changes in sampling design or intensity.

# INTRODUCTION

Under the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (NPFMC) Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Eastern Bering Sea, Aleutian Islands, and Gulf of Alaska, Tier 1--3 stocks use statistical catch-at-age assessment models to estimate population and management quantities [@NPFMC2020bsai; @NPFMC2020goa].
While these models can vary in their specific implementation across stocks (i.e., due to differences in parameterization, error structures, or data availability), a critical and ubiquitous data component is age and length composition data.
Age and length composition data are collected on both fishery-independent (e.g., bottom trawl or longline surveys) and fishery-dependent platforms, providing critical data to assessments in order to track population changes over time.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) operates fishery-independent bottom trawl surveys [@Stauffer2004] that span most of the continental shelf and a portion of the continental slope for federal waters off Alaska. 
Proceeding southward from the Bering Strait, these waters include the eastern Bering Sea (EBS), the Aleutian Islands (AI), and the Gulf of Alaska (GOA).
These surveys provide age and length composition data for 26 stocks (or stock complexes) assessed or updated on a pre-established and frequent cycle with statistical catch-at-age models.

At the AFSC, age and length frequency sampling from bottom trawl surveys is used in stock assessment models in many ways to inform estimates of population abundance that are subsequently used to set management quantities, as well as stock status that is used nationally to measure agency success on legislative mandates.
The most common use of length frequency sampling at the AFSC is to derive estimates of the population abundance-at-length that are used in conjunction with an age-length key to estimate population estimates at age, which are then converted to age composition (i.e., proportions-at-age) and fit in the model [e.g., @Monnahan2021; @Spencer2022]. 
Length frequency samples are also used in many assessments in a conditional-age-at-length framework [@Rudd2021] that both fit the length compositions and enables estimation of growth internally to the assessment [e.g., @Mcgilliard2017]. 
In some cases, where age data is not available, length frequency samples that have been expanded to population abundance-at-length estimates are used directly as composition data (i.e., proportions-at-length) within the assessment [e.g., @Mcgilliard2019]. 
Finally, recent developments have incorporated length frequency samples in a model-based framework to estimate length and age composition that are subsequently integrated into the assessment model [@Thorson2019; @Ianelli2021; @Thompson2021].

Predominantly, the multinomial likelihood is used to fit age and length composition data at the AFSC [e.g., @Bryan2021], while recently the Dirichlet-Multinomial has also been explored [e.g., @Barbeaux2022].
A common requirement, regardless of the likelihood employed, is a pre-determination of the input sample size that is used to 'weight' each year's age or length composition data.
This weight subsequently influences the precision of the assessment model's fit to the particular composition data.
Over the years, a variety of approaches have been used at AFSC to set the input sample size in stock assessments.
These include selecting a constant value [e.g., @Hulson2022], relating the input sample size to the number of hauls from which age or length composition data was collected [e.g., @Spencer2022], relating the input sample size to the nominal sample size [e.g., @Hulson2021], or relating the input sample size to some combination of hauls and nominal sample size [e.g., @Williams2022].
Overall, there is no consensus method that is agreed upon at the AFSC to determine input sample size.

@Stewart2014 introduced a method in which bootstrap techniques were used to resample age and length composition data that provides an estimate of the input sample size that can be used within assessment models.
The primary advantage of this method is that it provides an objective framework from which estimates of input sample size are obtained that mimics the sampling design employed (i.e., design-based estimation), either from a fishery-independent survey or on fishery-dependent platforms.
Other methods have also been developed, including model-based [@Thorson2014; @Thorson2018] or methods that combine design and model-based elements [@Miller2006].
Here, we apply the methods of @Stewart2014 to obtain annual estimates of input sample size for age and length composition data obtained by the AFSC bottom trawl surveys in the EBS, AI, and GOA for all stocks assessed at AFSC with statistical catch-at-age assessment models.
The main objectives of this technical memorandum are to 1) document methods used by AFSC for expanding length and age collections to population abundance estimates (which are subsequently used as composition data in stock assessments), 2) present stock-specific results of input samples size from AFSC bottom trawl surveys for Tier 1--3 stocks, and 3) record methods for estimating input sample sizes of survey-based age and length compositions using a two-stage bootstrapping approach.

# MATERIALS AND METHODS

## Survey Data

Data collection for each AFSC groundfish survey is described in NOAA Technical Memoranda [EBS: @Lauth2019; AI: @vonSzalay2017; GOA: @vonSzalay2018].
Length frequency protocols and a recent analysis of sex-specific length frequency data are further described in @Hulson2023a.
To facilitate age estimation, individual fish are processed at sea; sex, length and weight are recorded and sagittal otoliths are extracted and returned to the AFSC Age and Growth laboratory for age determination.
Survey age sampling protocols are species-specific and follow 1 of 2 paradigms: 1) a stratified collection distributed over both the survey's spatial extent and the expected size range of the species; or 2) a small subsample (3-6 fish, species-dependent) collected randomly (i.e., no size-stratification) per haul.
The protocol for some species has changed over the time series, which has followed a trend of transitioning from protocol 1) (stratified sampling) to protocol 2) (random sample). 

Species collected on each survey that are assessed with statistical catch-at-age models were selected to be included in this analysis (Tier 1--3 stock assessments, Table \@ref(tab:species)). 
Data from AFSC bottom trawl surveys conducted in the EBS shelf (1982 to present), EBS slope (2002, 2004, 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2016), AI (triennially from 1991 to 2000, biennially from 2000 to present with the exception of 2008 and 2020 in which no surveys took place), and GOA (triennially from 1990 to 1999, bienially from 1999 to present) that are employed in the stock assessment models for each respective area were used in this study to estimate input sample size with a bootstrap estimator.
The bootstrap estimator is designed to be a standardized tool for generating input sample sizes and the input sample sizes generated with it are intended to be used to weight length and age composition data in future sotck assessments. 

## Expanding Length Frequency to Population Abundance-at-Length

Length frequency samples collected by the AFSC bottom trawl surveys are expanded by catch and stratum area to obtain estimates of population abundance-at-length [this approach is also detailed in @Hulson2023a, we include the description here to provide a source for both the length and age expansions].
This is often referred to as the 'first stage expansion' and is a common method to obtain population abundance estimates at length from area-swept survey data [e.g., @Ailloud2019; @Miller2006].
Population abundance-at-length is computed for three sex categories at the stratum level: males, females, and unsexed; these estimates are then summed across strata to obtain the population abundance-at-length for the management-scale region (i.e., EBS, AI, or GOA).
However, these estimates can also be summed to any sub-region level.
To expand the species-specific length frequency samples to population-at-length we first compute the overall numbers within a stratum by multiplying the average catch per unit effort within the strata (i.e., the number of fish per square kilometer averaged across the hauls performed within the strata) by the area of the strata (in square kilometers).
We then compute the relative catch per unit effort for each haul performed within the strata and the sex-specific relative length frequency for each haul.
The expanded population-at-length is obtained by multiplying the numbers within the strata, the relative catch per unit effort of each haul, and the sex-specific relative length frequency.
This process is shown in mathematical form in the following.

In the first step of this process we compute the overall population numbers in year-*y* within stratum-*st* ($\hat{N}_{s,y}$) with

\begin{equation}
 \hat{N}_{s,y}=\overline{CPUE}_{s,y}\cdot A_{s}
  (\#eq:eqn1)
\end{equation}
where $A_{s}$ is the area of stratum-*s* (in km^2^), and $\overline{CPUE}_{s,y}$ is the species-specific average catch per unit effort of numbers captured across the hauls within a strata in year-*y*, given by

\begin{equation}
 \overline{CPUE}_{s,y}
  =\frac{1}{H_{s,y}}\sum_{h=1}^{H_{s,y}}CPUE_{h,s,y}
  =\frac{1}{H_{s,y}}\sum_{h=1}^{H_{s,y}}\frac{N_{h,s,y}}{E_{h,s,y}}
  (\#eq:eqn2)
\end{equation}
where $H_{s,y}$ is the number of hauls conduscted in stratum-*s* in year-*y*, $CPUE_{h,s,y}$ is the catch per unit effort (i.e, numbers caught divided by effort) within a haul-*h*, $N_{h,s,y}$ is the catch (in numbers) in haul-*h* for stratum-*s* in year-*y*, and $E_{h,s,y}$ is the effort in haul-*h* for stratum-*s* in year-*y*.
Effort is computed as the net width multiplied by the distance the trawl was in contact with the seafloor, or, the area swept by the haul (in km^2^).
Next, the proportion of catch per unit effort among hauls ($\hat{p}_{C,h,s,y}$) is computed by

\begin{equation}
\hat{p}_{C,h,s,y}=\frac{CPUE_{h,s,y}}{\sum_{h=1}^{H_{s,y}}CPUE_{h,s,y}}
  (\#eq:eqn3)
\end{equation}
where $CPUE_{h,s,y}$ is the catch per unit effort of numbers caught within a haul-*h* for stratum-*s* in year-*y*.
We then compute the sex-specific proportion of the total number of lengths sampled within a haul by length ($\hat{p}_{x,l,h,s,y}$) with

\begin{equation}
 \hat{p}_{x,l,h,s,y} =
  \begin{cases}
    (1) \frac{N_{x,l,h,s,y}}{N_{h,s,y}} &N_{x,h,s,y}>0  \\
    (2) \frac{\sum_{h=1}^{H_{s,y}}[N_{x,l,h,s,y}/N_{h,s,y}]}{\sum_{x=1}^{3}\sum_{l=1}^{L}\sum_{h=1}^{H_{s,y}}[N_{x,l,h,s,y}/N_{h,s,y}]} &N_{x,h,s,y}=0
  \end{cases}
  (\#eq:eqn4)
\end{equation}
where $N_{x,l,h,s,y}$ is the length frequency sampled, in numbers, by sex-*x* and length-*l* (in cm) within a haul-*h* for stratum-*s* in year-*y*.
In some hauls that have catch for a species there is no length frequency data that was collected (i.e, $N_{x,h,s,y}=0$); this occurs infrequently, but does occur in the historical data.
When this occurs case (2) is applied in \@ref(eq:eqn4), where the data are pooled for each sex across all the hauls conducted and used in place of the missing length frequency data for that haul to account for the unknown length frequency in these hauls.
Otherwise, if length frequency samples are obtained case (1) is applied.
Finally, we estimate the sex-specific population abundance-at-length within strata-*s* with

\begin{equation}
 \hat{N}_{x,l,s,y}=\sum_{h=1}^{H_{s,y}}[\hat{N}_{s,y}\cdot\hat{p}_{C,h,s,y}\cdot\hat{p}_{x,l,h,s,y}]
  (\#eq:eqn5)
\end{equation}
and to obtain the sex-specific estimates of population abundance-at-length in a management area one would simply sum $\hat{N}_{x,l,s,y}$ across strata.


## Expanding Specimen Collections to Population Abundance-at-Age

In the second stage expansion the sex-specific estimates of population abundance-at-length are used to estimate sex-specific population abundance-at-age.
The annual specimen data that are collected during the survey, which include observations of age-at-length, are first populated into sex-specific numbers at age and length ($N_{x,a,l,y}$).
Next, the sex-specific numbers-at-age and length are converted to sex-specific proportions of age-at-length (i.e., age-length key) with

\begin{equation}
 \hat{p}_{x,a,l,y}=\frac{N_{x,a,l,y}}{\sum_{a=1}^{A}N_{x,a,l,y}}
  (\#eq:eqn6)
\end{equation}
The proportions of age-at-length are then expanded to population abundance-at-age with

\begin{equation}
 \hat{N}_{sx,a,y}=\sum_{l=1}^{L}\hat{p}_{x,a,l,y}\cdot \hat{N}_{x,l,y}
  (\#eq:eqn7)
\end{equation}
where $\hat{N}_{x,l,y}$ is the population abundance-at-length from \@ref(eq:eqn5) summed across strata.
For specimen age data with observations of sex (either female or male), the sex-specific specimen age data is used.
However, for specimen age data without observations of sex, the specimen age data are pooled across all sexes and the unsexed population abundance-at-length is then applied to the pooled specimen data to estimate unsexed population abundance-at-age.

Two general categories of special cases for several stock assessments were also included in our analysis: 1) spatially-explicit assessments, and 2) assessments of species complexes. 
Population abundance-at-age estimates are computed at the management area scale (e.g., the entire GOA, AI, or EBS) for the majority of stocks assessed at AFSC; however, we note that there are two flatfish stock assessments that are spatially-explicit in the GOA [@Mcgilliard2017; @Bryan2021].
While in the preceding equations we do not include a subscript for sub-region, population abundance-at-age can be estimated by sub-region by summing the population abundance-at-length in equation \@ref(eq:eqn5) across selected strata within the region that correspond to the sub-region and applying equations \@ref(eq:eqn6) and \@ref(eq:eqn7) to specimen age data that are subsetted to the sub-region.
We have developed functions to estimate population abundance-at-age by sub-region, and by a combination of sub-regions within the GOA to allow for this flexibility in estimating population abundance-at-age.
There are also assessments evaluating stocks at a complex level, where several species are included together in an assessment.
In addition, there are two stock complexes managed by AFSC in which the species are combined and assessed within the same statistical catch-at-age model: blackspotted and rougheye rockfish in the GOA and AI [@Spencer2020b; @Sullivan2021].
Between the two management regions there are subtle differences in how the population abundance-at-age is estimated from the survey specimen age data.
The difference between each region is that complex specimen age data are pooled prior to age expansion [@Spencer2020b], or the specimen age data are not pooled and population-at-age for each species are summed after expansion [@Sullivan2021].
We have developed functions that allow for these differences and estimate population abundance-at-age for these two stock complexes. 
In a similar case, while not assessed as a complex, over the historical bottom trawl survey in the GOA several species codes have been used for dusky rockfish. 
We have also developed a custom function that estimates population abundance-at-length and age for this case. 


## Bootstrap Framework for Estimating Age and Length Composition Input Sample Size

To estimate the historical input sample sizes for age and length compositions of stocks assessed at AFSC we developed a nonparameteric bootstrap framework based on the methodology outlined in @Stewart2014 and expanding on recent work [@Siskey2023]. 
The bootstrap framework is composed of a suite of nested resampling (with replacement) protocols.
Functions to run the sampling protocols were developed in a compartmentalized manner to provide for flexibility in exploring desired resampling protocols. 
The order of operations (Figure \@ref(fig:length)) has the following schedule, with steps 1-3 being optional switches (so that the uncertainty that results from resampling at each step can be tested):

1.  Resample hauls from the set of hauls with associated catch per unit effort (in numbers)
2.  Within the resampled hauls from step 1, resample the observed length frequency data
3.  Within the resampled hauls from step 1, resample the observed specimen data
4.  From the resampled length frequency data in step 2, calculate sex-specific population abundance-at-length, using equations \@ref(eq:eqn1) - \@ref(eq:eqn5)
5.  From the resampled specimen age data in step 3 and the sex-specific population abundance-at-length in step 4, calculate sex-specific population abundance-at-age, using equations \@ref(eq:eqn6) - \@ref(eq:eqn7)

Steps 1-5 were repeated iteratively, providing sex-specific population abundance-at-length and age that was then compared to the observed sex-specific population abundance-at-length and age as from the bottom trawl surveys.
We completed 500 iterations of the bootstrap-simulation, variability in the population abundance-at-length had stabilized at that point.
The bootstrap-simulation was developed in R [@Rcore] and is available via GitHub as an R package (<https://github.com/BenWilliams-NOAA/surveyISS>).


## Computing Input Sample Size

Realized sample size ($R$), as introduced by @Mcallister1997, is a statistic that can evaluate the level of intra-haul correlation in age or length composition samples that are collected on a survey.
It is also a statistic that can evaluate the amount of uncertainty in an estimated composition compared to an observed composition.
Realized sample size is given by

\begin{equation}
 R=\frac{\sum_{c=1}^{C}E_c(1-E_c)}{\sum_{c=1}^{C}(E_c-O_c)^2}
 (\#eq:eqn8)
\end{equation}
where $E_c$ is the estimated proportion for category-*c* (which can be either age or length or any other arbitrary category across which proportions are computed) and $O_c$ is the observed proportion.
A higher $R$ indicates less uncertainty in the composition estimates, while a lower $R$ indicates more uncertainty. 

In this bootstrap-simulation, we used realized sample size to calculate uncertainty in length compositions for each simulation iteration, where the underlying age and length compositions derived from the historical bottom trawl surveys were treated as the observed proportions $O_c$ in equation \@ref(eq:eqn8).
For each iteration of the bootstrapped survey data we computed a sex-specific estimated proportion ($E_c$) that was then compared to the underlying historical sex-specific age and length composition (the realized sample size for the total age and length composition was also comupted as the sum of population abundance-at-age and length).
Thus, for each iteration of the simulation, we computed an realized sample size that quantifies the amount of uncertainty that resulted from that iteration of sub-sampling sexed length frequency data.
This resulted in distributions of realized sample size for each stock, each sex, and each sub-region of interest

Input sample size ($ISS$) is defined as a metric of uncertainty used in data-weighting procedures for stock assessment models.
An input sample size is usually assigned to annual length compositions in the model fitting process, but there are a variety of methods for calculation and are closely related to the information content of the data product in question.
To summarize uncertainty across bootstrap iterations of $R$, we calculated $ISS$ as the harmonic mean of realized sample size across bootstrap iterations

\begin{equation}
 ISS=\frac{I}{\sum_{i=1}^{I}(R_i)^{-1}}
 (\#eq:eqn9)
\end{equation}
where $ISS$ is the annual input sample size, $ESS_i$ is the realized sample size for iteration-*i*, and *I* is the total number of iterations for which the bootstrap procedure is run.
The harmonic mean has been shown to reduce bias in recovering the true sample size in simulations for a multinomial distribution.
Due to this reduction in bias the harmonic mean has also been recommended to determine the $ISS$ that is used in stock assessment models to fit compositional data [@Stewart2014].
Herein, we use the term 'realized sample size or $R$' to refer to the realized sample sizes that were computed for each iteration of the bootstrap-simulation from equation \@ref(eq:eqn8), and the term 'input sample size or $ISS$' to refer to the harmonic mean of the iterated realized sample sizes from equation \@ref(eq:eqn9).


# RESULTS

Average age and length composition nominal sample sizes (i.e., number of length samples collected on deck or number of otoliths aged in the laboratory, rounded to the nearest 10s for age and 100s for length) for each species and year bottom trawl surveys evaluated are shown in Tables \@ref(tab:ebs-nss) - \@ref(tab:goai-nss).
Across the surveys, average sex-specific length frequency nominal sample size ranged from 300--35,600 samples per year, where the total length frequency nominal sample size (for all sexes combined) ranged from around 700--82,500 per year.
The most frequently sampled species for length frequency within the EBS shelf survey were walleye pollock, yellowfin sole, northern rock sole, and arrowtooth flounder, while arrowtooth flounder, kamchatka flounder, and Pacific ocean perch were the most frequently sampled in the EBS slope survey (Table \@ref(tab:ebs-nss)).
The most frequently sampled species for length frequency within the Aleutian Islands bottom trawl survey were Pacific ocean perch, walleye pollock, and arrowtooth flounder and in the Gulf of Alaska bottom trawl survey were arrowtooth flounder, walleye pollock, flathead sole, and Pacific ocean perch (Table \@ref(tab:goai-nss)).
Across the surveys, average sex-specific otolith nominal sample sizes ranged from 130--850 per year, while the total otolith nominal sample size (for all sexes combined) ranged from 290--1,550 per year.
It was commonly the case that the most frequently sampled species in each survey for otoliths were the most frequently sampled species for length frequency.

The age and length composition $ISS$ output of the surveyISS package is structured by year, species (using the AFSC survey species code), sex, and region (an example of the output is shown in Table \@ref(tab:surveyISS-examp)).
Using walleye pollock total (combined sex) age composition as an example, $ISS$ is produced by year for each survey the stock is sampled from (Figure \@ref(fig:wallpoll-iss)).
Sex-specific yellowfin sole age composition from the EBS shelf survey composition $ISS$ is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:yellsol-iss).
For all species sampled in each survey, the range and median of total and sex-specific length composition $ISS$ across survey years is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:length-iss), and age composition $ISS$ is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:age-iss).
Sub-regional $ISS$ for age and length composition can also be estimated within the GOA survey (Figures \@ref(fig:sublength-iss) and \@ref(fig:subage-iss)).
These results show that the length composition $ISS$ ranged from the hundreds to thousands and were larger than the age composition $ISS$.
Additionally, the sex-specific $ISS$ for either length or age composition were smaller than the $ISS$ for the total age compositions.
For both the age and length compositions $ISS$ the magnitude was species-specific, and was closely related to the overall sampling intensity for age and length observations on the surveys.

For both age and length compositions (including sex-specific composition data), the $ISS$ was smaller than the nominal sample sizes (Figure \@ref(fig:iss-nss), shown for age compositions) and there was a generally increasing trend between nominal sample size and input sample size with gadids being the exception.
Comparing the age composition $ISS$ to the number of hauls from which age samples were obtained did not result in a strong relationship for the flatfish and gadids sampled in the AFSC surveys, but $ISS$ tended to increase with increased number of hauls for the rockfish species (Figure \@ref(fig:iss-hls)).
There was an increasing trend between age composition $ISS$ per sampled haul and the number of samples per sampled haul for most of the species sampled, this trend was most striking for the flatfish species (Figure \@ref(fig:iss-nss-hls)).
The $ISS$ for age compositions sampled during AFSC surveys was 2.6 per sampled haul for flatfish, 1.7 per sampled haul for gadids, and 1.5 per sampled haul for rockfish.
This translated to 0.36 $ISS$ per age sample for flatfish, 0.22 $ISS$ per age sample for gadids, and 0.26 $ISS$ per age sample for rockfish.

# DISCUSSION

Here we have presented an application of the method outlined in @Stewart2014 to produce annual age and length composition $ISS$ for fishery stocks assessed by AFSC with statistical catch-at-age models.
We present results for the bottom trawl surveys conducted in the EBS shelf, slope, AI and GOA by AFSC with the hope that this will motivate the adoption of a standardized approach akin to ours for setting initial composition weights in future assessments.
This application produces total (combined sex) and sex-specific $ISS$, as well as sub-region $ISS$ within the GOA bottom trawl survey.
We found that the magnitude of age and length compositions $ISS$ can vary across stocks and years, but in general, age composition $ISS$ ranged from the tens to hundreds (with an average age $ISS$ of around 100 across all years and species) and length composition $ISS$ ranged from the hundreds to thousands (with an average length $ISS$ of around 1,000 across all years and species).
This is not surprising, given that the magnitude of sampling for length frequency is much larger than sampling for ages.
We also found that the sex-specific $ISS$ is smaller than the total (combined sex) $ISS$, which is also not surprising given the relatively smaller sampling intensity for sex-specific samples.
We will note from this result that care and intentionality should be taken when developing and implementing sex-specific assessments given this increase in uncertainty in composition data.

At the AFSC, as noted previously, there are a myriad of approaches employed to set $ISS$ for age and length composition data used in assessments.
There is no generally agreed upon approach, however, a common approach that has been implemented is set $ISS$ as some function of the number of hauls.
This follows from a result of @Pennington2000 who found the age composition $ISS$ to be one per sampled haul.
Herein we find the average age composition $ISS$ per haul by species group (gadid, flatish, and rockfish) to be larger than one per sampled haul.
We also find that, while there is a generally increasing relationship between the number of sampled hauls and the age composition $ISS$, and that the number of hauls and age composition $ISS$ are the same order of magnitude, the relationship between hauls and age composition $ISS$ is highly variable.
It is unclear as to the consequence of $ISS$ misspecification in AFSC assessments that use the number of sampled hauls as a proxy for $ISS$, as $ISS$ misspecification can lead to biased model results [@Stewart2017; @Xu2020].

We note that the results of the analysis conducted here does not strongly support the approach of using hauls as a proxy due to the large uncertainty and lack of correspondence when comparing $ISS$ to the number of sampled hauls.
In particular, we see no reason to use the relationship with number of hauls or number of samples.
The regression of $ISS$ and number of hauls results in substantial residual variance, both among years for a given species and across species, so using the predicted $ISS$ from that regression likely results in an estimate of $ISS$ that is less precise and more biased than the original calculations reported here.
Instead, we recommend that assessments directly use the $ISS$ calculated here (and as updated given future years of data).  

A strength of the methodology presented by @Stewart2014 is that it provides an objective method that produces estimates of $ISS$ that follow from the sampling design employed to collect data (i.e., design-based estimator).
As such, this approach has been adopted in a number of assessments, both internationally and domestically.
For example, this bootstrap approach has been applied to weight compositional data within the Pacific halibut stock assessment performed by the International Pacific Halibut Commission [@Stewart2022].
If adopted for assessments conducted at AFSC, this approach would provide an objective and unifying method to set $ISS$ when weighting compositional data.
Further analysis to be developed and conducted includes constructing methods that apply the bootstrap approach to fishery-dependent age and length composition used in AFSC assessments.
We recommend that the surveyISS package be adopted and further developed by assessment and survey programs at AFSC so that bootstrap derived $ISS$ is a standard data product available to scientists conducting assessments with statistical catch-at-age models at AFSC.
