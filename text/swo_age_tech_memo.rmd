# Introduction

Under the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (NPFMC) Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Eastern Bering Sea, Aleutian Islands, and Gulf of Alaska, Tier 1, 2, and 3 stocks use an age-structured assessment model to estimate population and management quantities [@NPFMC2020bsai; @NPFMC2020goa].
While these assessment models can vary in their specific implementation across stocks (i.e., parameterization or data availability), a critical and common data component of this structure of assessment model is age and length composition data.
Age and length composition data are collected on both fishery-independent (e.g., bottom trawl or longline surveys) and fishery-dependent platforms, providing critical data to assessments in order to track population changes over time.
The Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) operates fishery-independent surveys that then provide age and length composition data to 26 stocks (or stock complexes) assessed with age-structured models.

At the AFSC, age and length frequency sampling from the bottom trawl surveys is used in stock assessment models in a variety of ways to inform estimates of population abundance that are subsequently used to set management quantities.
The most common use of length frequency sampling is to derive estimates of the population abundance at length that are then used in an age-length key to estimate population estimates at age and the model is fit to these age composition estimates [e.g., @Spencer2022; @Monnahan2021]. 
Length frequency samples are also used in many assessments in a conditional-age-at-length framework [e.g., @Rudd2021] that both fits the length composition and enables estimation of growth internally to the assessment [e.g., @Mcgilliard2017]. 
In some cases, where age data is not available, length frequency samples which have been expanded to population abundance at length estimates are used directly as composition data within the assessment [e.g., @Mcgilliard2019]. 
Finally, recent developments have included using length frequency samples in a model-based framework to estimate length and age composition estimates [@Thorson2019; @Ianelli2021; @Thompson2021].

Predominantly, the multinomial likelihood is used to fit age and length composition data at the AFSC [e.g., @Bryan2021], while recently the Dirichlet-Multinomial has also been explored [@Barbeaux2022].
A common requirement, regardless of the likelihood employed, is a pre-determination of the input sample size that is used to 'weight' the particular year's age or length composition that is subsequently fit by the assessment model.
Over the years, a variety of approaches have been used at AFSC to set the input sample size in stock assessments.
These include selecting a constant value [e.g., @Hulson2022b], relating the input sample size to the number of hauls from which age or length composition data was collected [e.g., @Spencer2022], relating the input sample size to the nominal sample size [e.g., @Hulson2021], or relating the input sample size to some combination of hauls and nominal sample size [e.g., @Williams2022].
Overall, there is no general or consensus method that is agreed upon at the AFSC to determine input sample size.

@Stewart2014 introduced a method in which bootstrap techniques were used to resample age and length composition data that provides an estimate of the input sample size that can be used within assessment models.
The primary advantage of this method is that it provides an objective framework from which estimates of input sample size are obtained that mimic the sampling design employed, either on a fishery-independent survey or on fishery-dependent platforms.
Here, we apply the methods of @Stewart2014 to obtain historical estimates of input sample size for age and length composition data for all stocks assessed at AFSC with age-structured assessment models.
The main objectives of this technical memorandum are to 1) document methods used by AFSC for expanding length and age collections to population abundance estimates (which are subsequently used as composition data in stock assessments), 2) present stock-specific results of historical input samples size for Tier $\geq$ 3 stocks, and 3) record methods for estimating input sample sizes of survey-based age and length compositions using a two-stage bootstrapping approach.

# Materials and Methods

## Survey data

Data collection for each AFSC groundfish survey is described in respective NOAA Technical Memorandum [EBS: @Lauth2019; AI: @vonSzalay2017; GOA: @vonSzalay2018].
Length frequency protocols and recent analysis of historical data are further described in @Hulson2022a.

To facilitate age estimation, individual fish are processed at sea to record sex, length and weight and to remove sagittal otoliths that are returned the AFSC Age and Growth laboratory for age determination.
Survey age sampling protocols are specific by fish species and follow 1 of 2 paradigms: 1) a stratified collection that is distributed over both the spatial frame of the stratification scheme and the expected size range of a species; or 2) a small subsample (3-6 fish, depneding on species) collected randomly per trawl.
The protocol for some species has changed over the time series, which has followed a trend of transitioning from protocol 1) to protocol 2).
Age-length-keys (ALKs) generated from the age/length observations within a survey are then applied to estimated size compositions to provide an estimate of population age composition.
Currently, no species age composition are estimated using stratified ALKs, rather, all observations are pooled for the entirety of the survey area each survey year.
When there is no corresponding age observation for an observed length bin in a single survey, age-at-length observations for all years are pooled to assign ages to that length bin.
This is different in AI/GOA, where the age obs are just dropped.

Species within each survey that are assessed with statistical catch-at-age models (Tier $\geq$ 3 stock assessments, Table \@ref(tab:species)) were selected to be included in this analysis (shown by groupings in Table \@ref(tab:species-group)).
The database (i.e., RACEBASE) was queried based on functions used in the sumfish package in Program R (<https://github.com/afsc-gap-products/sumfish>).

## Expanding length frequency to population abundance at length

Length frequency samples collected by the AFSC bottom trawl surveys are expanded by catch and stratum area to obtain estimates of population abundance at length (this approach is also detailed in @Hulson2022a, we include the description here as well in order to provide a source for both the length and age expansions for reference).
This is often referred to as the 'first stage expansion' and is a common method to obtain population estimates at length from area-swept survey data [e.g., @Ailloud2019, @Miller2006].
Population abundance at length are computed for three sex categories: males, females, and unsexed at the stratum level, which are then summed across stratum to obtain the population abundance at length for the management-scale region (i.e., EBS, AI, or GOA), these can also be summed to any sub-region level.

In the first step of this process we compute the overall population numbers in year-*y* within stratum-*st* ($\hat{N}_{st,y}$) with:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
 \hat{N}_{st,y}=\overline{CPUE}_{st,y}\cdot A_{st}
  (\#eq:eqn1)
\end{equation}
```
where $A_{st}$ is the area of stratum-*st* (in km^2^), and $\overline{CPUE}_{st,y}$ is the average catch per unit effort of numbers captured across the hauls within a strata, given by:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
 \overline{CPUE}_{st,y}
  =\frac{1}{H_{st,y}}\sum_{h=1}^{H_{st,y}}CPUE_{h,st,y}
  =\frac{1}{H_{st,y}}\sum_{h=1}^{H_{st,y}}\frac{n_{h,st,y}}{E_{h,st,y}}
  (\#eq:eqn2)
\end{equation}
```
where $H_{st,y}$ is the number of hauls, $CPUE_{h,st,y}$ is the catch per unit effort of numbers caught within a haul-*h*, $n_{h,st,y}$ is the catch (in numbers) in haul-*h*, and $E_{h,st,y}$ is the effort in haul-*h*, which is computed as the net width multiplied by the time on bottom, or, the area swept by the haul (in km^2^).
Next, the ratio of catch per unit effort among hauls ($\hat{p}_{CPUE,h,st,y}$) is computed by:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\hat{p}_{CPUE,h,st,y}=\frac{CPUE_{h,st,y}}{\sum_{h=1}^{H_{sy,y}}CPUE_{h,st,y}}
  (\#eq:eqn3)
\end{equation}
```
where $CPUE_{h,st,y}$ is the catch per unit effort of numbers caught within a haul-*h*.
We then compute the sex-specific ratio of the total number of lengths sampled within a haul by length ($\hat{p}_{sx,l,h,st,y}$) with:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
 \hat{p}_{sx,l,h,st,y} =
  \begin{cases}
    (1) \frac{N_{sx,l,h,st,y}}{N_{h,st,y}}  \\
    (2) \frac{\sum_{h=1}^{H_{st,y}}[N_{sx,l,h,st,y}/N_{h,st,y}]}{\sum_{sx=1}^{3}\sum_{l=1}^{L}\sum_{h=1}^{H_{st,y}}[N_{sx,l,h,st,y}/N_{h,st,y}]}
  \end{cases}
  (\#eq:eqn4)
\end{equation}
```
where $N_{sx,l,h,st,y}$ is the length frequency sampled, in numbers, by sex-*sx* and length-*l*.
In some cases there are hauls that have catch for a species but did not collect length frequency data, in this case (2) is applied in order to account for the unknown length frequency in these hauls, otherwise, if length frequency samples are obtained case (1) is applied.
Finally, we estimate the sex-specific population abundance at length within strata-st with:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
 \hat{N}_{sx,l,st,y}=\hat{N}_{st,y}\cdot\hat{p}_{CPUE,h,st,y}\cdot\hat{p}_{sx,l,h,st,y}
  (\#eq:eqn5)
\end{equation}
```
and to obtain the sex-specific estimates of population abundance at length in a management area one would simply sum $\hat{N}_{sx,l,st,y}$ across strata.

## Expanding specimen collections to population abundance at age

In the second stage expansion the sex-specific estimates of population abundance at length are used to estimate sex-specific population abundance at age.
The annual specimen data that is collected during the survey, which includes observations of age at length, are first populated into sex-specific numbers at age and length ($N_{sx,a,l,y}$).
Next, the sex-specific numbers at age and length are converted to sex-specific proportions of age at length with:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
 \hat{p}_{sx,a,l,y}=\frac{N_{sx,a,l,y}}{\sum_{a=1}^{A}N_{sx,a,l,y}}
  (\#eq:eqn6)
\end{equation}
```
The proportions of age at length are then expanded to population abundance at age with:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
 \hat{N}_{sx,a,y}=\sum_{l=1}^{L}\hat{p}_{sx,a,l,y}\cdot \hat{N}_{sx,l,y}
  (\#eq:eqn7)
\end{equation}
```
where $\hat{N}_{sx,l,y}$ is the population abundance at length from \@ref(eq:eqn5) summed across strata.
For specimen data with observations of sex (either female or male), the sex-specific specimen data is used, however, for specimen data without observations of sex the specimen data is pooled across all sexes and the unsexed population abundance at length is then applied to the pooled specimen data to estimate unsexed population abundance at age.

For the majority of stocks assessed at AFSC age population estimates are computed at the management area scale (e.g., the entire GOA, AI, or EBS), however, we note that there are two flatfish stock assessments that are spatially-explicit in the GOA [@Mcgilliard2017; @Bryan2021].
While in the preceding equations we do not include a subscript for sub-region, population abundance at age can be estimated by sub-region through summing the population abundance at length in equation \@ref(eq:eqn5) across strata within the sub-region and applying equations \@ref(eq:eqn6) and \@ref(eq:eqn7) to specimen data that is subsetted to the sub-region.
We have developed functions to estimate population abundance at age by sub-region, and by a combination of sub-regions within the GOA to allow for this flexibility in estimating population abundance at age.

There are a handful of assessments conducted at AFSC that evaluate stocks at a complex level, where several species are included together in an assessment.
There are two stock complexes at AFSC in which the species are combined and assessed within the same statistical catch-at-age model: blackspotted and rougheye rockfish in the GOA and AI [@Spencer2020b; @Sullivan2021].
Between the two management regions there are subtle differences in how the population abundance at age is estimated from the survey specimen data; we have developed functions that allow for these differences and estimate population abundance at age for these two stock complexes.

## Bootstrap framework for estimating age and length composition input sample size

To estimate the historical input sample sizes for age and length compositions of stocks assessed at AFSC we developed a bootstrap framework based on the methodology outlined in @Stewart2014.
The bootstrap framework is composed of a suite of nested resampling (with replacement) protocols.
Functions to run the sampling protocols were developed in a compartmentalized manner to provide for substantial flexibility in exploring desired resampling protocols.
The order of operations (Figure \@ref(fig:length)) has the following schedule, with steps 1-3 being optional switches:

1.  Resample hauls from the set of hauls with associated catch per unit effort (in numbers)
2.  Within the resampled hauls from step 1, resample the observed length frequency data
3.  Within the resampled hauls from step 1, resample the observed specimen data
4.  From the resampled length frequency data in step 2, calculate sex-specific population abundance at length, using equations \@ref(eq:eqn1) - \@ref(eq:eqn5)
5.  From the resampled specimen data in step 3 and the sex-specific population abundance at length in step 4, calculate sex-specific population abundance at age, using equations \@ref(eq:eqn6) - \@ref(eq:eqn7)

The bootstrap framework then repeated steps 1-5 iteratively, providing iterated sex-specific population abundance at length and age that was then compared to the historical sex-specific population abundance at length and age determined by the bottom trawl surveys.
We applied the bootstrap-simulation to stocks that are assessed in the EBS, AI, and GOA with statistical catch-at-age models (or are Tier $\geq$ 3).
We ran the bootstrap-simulation for 500 iterations, which was a level for which the variability in population abundance at length results had stabilized, and applied the bootstrap-simulation to all years of the respective bottom trawl surveys through the 2021 surveys (for species that had specimen data completed by the AFSC Age and Growth Program).
The bootstrap-simulation was developed in R [@Rcore] and is available via GitHub as an R package (<https://github.com/BenWilliams-NOAA/swo>).

## Computing effective and input sample size

Effective sample size, as introduced by @Mcallister1997, is a statistic that can evaluate the level of intra-haul correlation in composition samples that are collected on a survey (whether from age or length frequency collections).
It is also a statistic that can evaluate the amount of uncertainty in an estimated composition compared to an observed composition.
Effective sample size is given by:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
 ESS=\frac{\sum_{c=1}^{C}E_c(1-E_c)}{\sum_{c=1}^{C}(E_c-O_c)^2}
 (\#eq:eqn8)
\end{equation}
```
where $E_c$ is the estimated proportion for category-*c* (which can be either age or length or any other arbitrary category across which proportions are computed) and $O_c$ is the observed proportion.

In this bootstrap framework the underlying age and length compositions derived from the historical bottom trawl surveys was treated as the observed proportions $O_c$ in equation \@ref(eq:eqn8).
For each iteration of the bootstrap we computed a sex-specific estimated proportion ($E_c$) that was then compared to the underlying historical sex-specific age and length composition (the effective sample size for the total age and length composition, as the sum of population abundance at age and length, was also computed).
To summarize effective sample size across iterations we used the harmonic mean, which has been shown to reduce bias in recovering the true sample size in simulations for a multinomial distribution.
Due to this reduction in bias the harmonic mean has also been recommended to determine the 'input sample size' that is used in stock assessment models to fit compositional data [@Stewart2014].
Herein, when we use the term 'effective sample size' we are referring to the effective sample sizes that were computed for each iteration of the bootstrap-simulation.
When we use the term 'input sample size' we are referring to the harmonic mean of the iterated effective sample sizes, which has been recommended to be used to weight composition data in stock assessment models.

# Results

Average length composition nominal sample sizes and estimated input sample sizes for the bottom trawl surveys evaluated are shown in Tables \@ref(tab:ebs-shelf-length) - \@ref(tab:goa-length).
Across the surveys, average sex-specific length composition nominal sample size ranged from around 300 to upwards of 35,000 samples per year, where the total length composition nominal sample size (for all sexes combined) ranged from around 700 to upwards of 82,000 per year.
The most frequently sampled species within in Eastern Bering Sea shelf survey were walleye pollock, yellowfin sole, northern rock sole, and arrowtooth flounder (Table \@ref(tab:ebs-shelf-length)), and in the Eastern Bering Sea slope survey were arrowtooth flounder, kamchatka flounder, and Pacific ocean perch (Table \@ref(tab:ebs-slope-length)).
The most frequently sampled species within the Aleutian Islands bottom trawl survey were Pacific ocean perch, walleye pollock, and arrowtooth flounder (Table \@ref(tab:ai-length)).
The most frequently sampled species in the Gulf of Aslaska bottom trawl survey were arrowtooth flounder, walleye pollock, flathead flounder, and Pacific ocean perch (Table \@ref(tab:goa-length)).
Estimated input sample sizes for length composition were smaller than the nominal sample sizes, as expected.
It was generally the case that length composition input sample sizes ranged in the thousands for species that were more commonly sampled in the bottom trawl surveys, and were less than 1,000 for species that weren't (Tables \@ref(tab:ebs-shelf-length) - \@ref(tab:goa-length)).
Sex-specific length composition input sample size ranged from 35 to greater than 3,500, with a mean around 700.
Total length composition (all sexes combined) input sample size ranged from around 100 to greater than 4,500 with a mean of just larger than 1,000.

Average age composition nominal sample sizes and estimated input sample sizes for the bottom trawl surveys evaluated are shown in Tables \@ref(tab:ebs-shelf-age) - \@ref(tab:goa-age).
Across the surveys, average sex-specific age composition nominal sample sizes ranged from around 130 to nearly 850 per year, where the total age composition nominal sample size (for all sexes combined) ranged from nearly 300 to over 1,500 per year.
It was commonly the case that the most frequently sampled species in each survey for age composition were similar to the most frequently sampled species for length composition.
Similar to the length composition results, estimated input sample sizes for age composition were smaller than the nominal sample sizes, as expected.
Sex-specific age composition input sample size ranged from 20 to nearly 300, with a mean around 100.
Total age composition (all sexes combined) input sample size ranged from around 50 to greater than 400 with a mean of just larger than 150.
It was the case that for each species and sex combination the age composition input sample size was smaller than the length composition input sample size.

In general, the input sample size for length composition was smaller than 10 per sampled haul, where the average number of lengths sampled per haul ranged from 10 - 60 (Figure \@ref(fig:length-per-haul)).
For flatfish, it was the case that as the length sampling per haul increased the input sample size increased.
However, for rockfish and roundfish, an increase in length sampling per haul did not result in an increase in the input sample size.
FOr rockfish and roundfish the input sample size per sampled haul did not exheed 5 regardless of the number of fish sampled for length within a haul.
The average input sample size per length sampled was 0.17 for flatfish and 0.1 for rockfish and roundfish.
It generally was the case across the species groupings that as the number of sampled hauls for length increased the length composition input sample size increased (Figure \@ref(fig:length-iss-haul)).
For flatfish the length composition input sample size was larger than the number of hauls for each of the surveys.
For rockfish and roundfish the relationship between the number of sampled hauls and length composition input sample size was nearly one-to-one, with the exceptions of roundfish in the Eastern Bering Sea shelf and Gulf of Alaska surveys.
In the Gulf of Alaska survey, the length composition input sample size for roundfish was seemingly invariant to the number of hauls sampled and did not increase as the number of sampled hauls for length increased.

In general, the input sample size for age composition ranged from less than 1 to 4 per sampled haul, where the average number of ages sampled per haul ranged from 1 to 20 (Figure \@ref(fig:age-per-haul)).
For each of the species groupings as the number of fish sampled for age per haul increased the input sample size for age composition increased, although the rate of increase was less than one-to-one.
The average input sample size per age sampled was 0.39 for flatfish, 0.27 for rockfish, and 0.19 for roundfish.
Similar to the length results, it was generally the case that as the number of sampled hauls for age increased the age composition input sample size increased (Figure \@ref(fig:age-iss-haul)), with the exception of roundfish in the Eastern Bering Sea shelf and Gulf of Alaska surveys.
